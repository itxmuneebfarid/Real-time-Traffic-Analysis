# Project Story: real Time Traffic analysis

In the busy digital city of London, traffic changes every second.
To solve the constant road chaos, Muneeb and Dawood created:

#  Real-Time Traffic Analysis System

A system designed to deliver fast, smart, and accurate traffic insights.

#  Graph Guru — Muneeb

Muneeb represented the entire city using a Graph Data Structure:

Every intersection → Node

Every road → Edge

Using this model, the system was able to:

Find shortest paths

Detect heavy traffic zones

Suggest alternative routes

Map real-time traffic flow

The graph ensured smooth and efficient navigation.

#  Stack Sentinel — Dawood

Dawood handled rapid traffic alerts using a Stack:

New alerts were pushed onto the stack

The latest (most urgent) alert was handled first (LIFO)

This helped the system react instantly to:

Sensor spikes

Accidents

Sudden road blocks

The stack ensured quick, priority-based alert processing.

# System Workflow

Traffic sensors generate live data

Alerts are stacked and processed immediately

Graph updates road weights & finds best routes

System displays:

Real-time congestion

Smart path suggestions

Automated traffic summaries

# Final Output

The Real-Time Traffic Analysis System provided:

Faster and optimized routing

Live congestion monitoring

Smart decision support

Efficient city-wide movement

#  Conclusion

With Graph for navigation and Stack for alerts,
Muneeb and Dawood built a smart, reliable, DS-powered real-time traffic analysis system that helps cities move smarter.
