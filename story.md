project title: real time traffic analysis
In the busy digital city of London, traffic changes every second. 
To solve daily road chaos, Muneeb and Dawood created “the Real-Time Traffic Analysis 
System.” 
Graph Guru Muneeb mapped every intersection as a node and each road as an edge, building a 
perfect graph of the city. 
His graph detected shortest paths, heavy traffic zones, and alternate routes. 
Meanwhile, Stack Sentinel Dawood managed incoming traffic alerts using a stack—latest and 
most urgent alerts were handled first. 
Whenever sensor spikes happened, alerts were pushed onto the stack and processed in order. 
The system showed real-time congestion, smart routes, and automated summaries. 
With Graph ensuring smooth navigation and Stack ensuring fast alert handling, London moved 
efficiently again. 
Together, they built a smart, reliable, DS-powered real time traffic analysis project.
